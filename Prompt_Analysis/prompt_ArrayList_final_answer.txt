## Role

Act as an impartial auditor specialized in detecting (i) **constraint coverage** and (ii) **inconsistencies/contradictions** in LLM outputs.

You will evaluate **FINAL_ANSWER** against two constraints: **Duplicate elements are allowed**, and **Fast random access.**

## Task

Given:

- **PROMPT**: the original task requirements
- **FINAL_ANSWER**: the model’s final answer

Deliver the metrics described below by following these steps:
A) Check if each constraint is **explicitly addressed** in the **FINAL_ANSWER** (presence flags).
B) Assess **FINAL_ANSWER** for contradictions or violations for each constraint (output inconsistency).
C) Extract brief **verbatim** excerpts that are incorrect or contradictory.
D) Add brief notes only as necessary.

**Important rules:**

- Use **only** the provided PROMPT / FINAL_ANSWER. Do not assume missing details.
- When quoting evidence, copy the text **verbatim**

## Context

### Inputs

**PROMPT**

<<<PROMPT_START

$prompt_content

PROMPT_END>>>

**FINAL_ANSWER**

<<<FINAL_ANSWER_START

$final_answer

FINAL_ANSWER_END>>>

### Definitions & Rules

Evaluate Output based on these definitions:

- **Condition 1 Duplicate elements allowed - Output (True/False)**: indicates whether the final answer explicitly states that duplicate elements are allowed
- **Condition 2 Random access by index - Output (True/False)**: indicates whether the final answer explicitly states that the collection supports fast random access, meaning direct access by index/position
- **Condition 1 Inconsistency - Output (True/False/-)**: evaluates the presence of contradictions in the final answer regarding the requirement that duplicate elements are allowed
    - *True:* contradictions are present in the text of the answer
    - *False:* contradictions are not present
    - *- (Not applicable):*  only if duplicates are never mentioned in the final answer
- **Condition 2 Inconsistency - Output (True/False/-)**: evaluates the presence of contradictions in the final answer regarding fast random access by index
    - *True:* contradictions are present in the text of the answer
    - *False:* contradictions are not present
    - *- (Not applicable):* only if index-based/random access is never mentioned in the final answer
- **Incorrect Statements - Output**: transcription of claims within the final answer that are contradictory or violate the prompt constraints

## Reasoning Steps

Justify each metric value using evidence from the **PROMPT**, and **FINAL_ANSWER** (succinctly, with quotes ≤25 words as needed, and short point-wise reasoning, approx. 5-10 points):

1. Identify expectations for **Duplicate elements are allowed**, and **Fast random access** from the **PROMPT** (noting ambiguity and how it is interpreted, if present).
2. In the **FINAL_ANSWER**:
    - Mark **Output presence** as True only if explicitly mentioned/committed to; otherwise False.
    - Mark **Output inconsistency** True if contradictions/violations exist; False if not; use - only if Output presence is False.
3. When a constraint is present or inconsistent, provide a short verbatim quote as evidence.

## Output Format

Your output must always include these four parts, in this exact order:

1. **Markdown Table**
    - One row per metric, columns: |Metric|Value|Note/justification|. Use **exact metric names** and **allowed string values** as defined above.
    - Justification should be concise (1–2 sentences). Include double-quoted short verbatim evidence when necessary.
2. **Incorrect Statements (verbatim excerpts)**
    - **Incorrect Statements – Output:** List up to 5 from FINAL_ANSWER, or 'None'.
3. **Final summary**
    - 4–6 bullet points including PASS / FAIL / NEEDS_REVISION, and top 1–2 reasons.
4. **Final JSON (for parsing)**
    - Output a valid JSON object wrapped by markers on their own lines
    - IMPORTANT:
        - Do NOT use markdown code fences (no ```json).
        - Do NOT bold the markers.
        - The first character after BEGIN_JSON must be '{' on the next line.
        - The last character before END_JSON must be '}' on the previous line.
        - The JSON must be parseable with a strict JSON parser (no trailing commas, no comments).
        - All "value" fields MUST be strings (never numbers like 0/1).
    - JSON MUST MATCH THIS EXACT TEMPLATE (copy it exactly; replace only the values/notes; no ellipses):
    BEGIN_JSON
    {
    "metrics": [
    {"metric": "Condition 1 Duplicate elements allowed - Output (True/False)", "value": "", "note": ""},
    {"metric": "Condition 2 Random access by index - Output (True/False)", "value": "", "note": ""},
    {"metric": "Condition 1 Inconsistency - Output (True/False/-)", "value": "", "note": ""},
    {"metric": "Condition 2 Inconsistency - Output (True/False/-)", "value": "", "note": ""},
    {"metric": "Incorrect Statements - Output", "value": "", "note": ""}
    ],
    "incorrect_statements_output": []
    }
    END_JSON

## Stop Conditions

- The output must contain **only** these 4 parts, **in this exact order**:

    1)Markdown table,  2) Incorrect Statements, 3) Final summary, 4) Final JSON.

    **Nothing else.**

- Table Note / Justification: max 1–2 sentences.
- The JSON must be **valid** (no comments, no trailing commas)
