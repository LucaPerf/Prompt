- **ID Test**: unique numerical identifier assigned to the single test execution
- **Name**: identifying name of the prompt
- **Model**: name of the Large Language Model (LLM) used for the test
- **Outcome (0/1)**: binary indicator of the correctness of the final solution
    - *0:* the model proposed the incorrect data structure
    - *1:* the model proposed the correct data structure
- **Proposed Structure**: specific data structure proposed by the model as the final solution
- **Condition 1 Uniqueness of the elements - Output (True/False)**: indicates whether the condition of uniqueness of the elements appears in the text of the final answer
- **Condition 2 Order of the elements - Output (True/False**): indicates whether the condition regarding the management of the order of the elements appears in the text of the final answer
- **Condition 3 Elements are sorted by values - Output (True/False)**: indicates whether the condition to sort the elements according to specific value attributes appears in the text of the final answer. The check includes the different formulations of the prompt:
    - *Formulation 1:* sorting *by family name, name and ID*
    - *Formulation 2:* sorting *by name*
    - *Formulation 3:* sorting *by street name*
- **Condition 1 Inconsistency - Output (True/False/-)**: evaluates the presence of contradictions in the final answer regarding the uniqueness constraint
    - *True:* contradictions are present in the text of the answer
    - *False:* contradictions are not present
    - *- (Not applicable):* to be selected if *Condition 1 - Output* is **False** (the model did not address the topic, making it impossible to evaluate inconsistency)
- **Condition 2 Inconsistency - Output (True/False/-)**: evaluates the presence of contradictions in the final answer regarding the management of the order of the elements
    - *True:* contradictions are present in the text of the answer
    - *False:* contradictions are not present
    - *- (Not applicable):* to be selected if *Condition 2 - Output* is **False**
- **Condition 3 Inconsistency - Output (True/False/-)**: evaluates the presence of contradictions in the final answer regarding the application of sorting criteria
    - *True:* contradictions are present in the text of the answer, or the proposed solution does not respect the required sorting hierarchy (e.g., priority *Family name* > *name* > *ID*)
    - *False:* contradictions are not present and the hierarchy is respected
    - *- (Not applicable)*: to be selected if *Condition 3 - Output* is **False**
- **Condition 1 Uniqueness of the elements - Reasoning (True/False)**: indicates whether, in the concluding part of the reasoning, the condition of uniqueness of the elements is present and confirmed as the definitive choice
- **Condition 2 Order of the elements - Reasoning (True/False**): indicates whether, in the concluding part of the reasoning, the condition regarding the management of the order of the elements is present and confirmed as the definitive choice
- **Condition 3 Elements are sorted by values - Reasoning (True/False)**: indicates whether, in the concluding part of the reasoning, the condition to sort the elements according to specific value attributes is present and confirmed. The check includes the different formulations of the prompt:
    - *Formulation 1:* sorting *by family name, name and ID*
    - *Formulation 2:* sorting *by name*
    - *Formulation 3:* sorting *by street name*
- **Condition 1 Inconsistency - Reasoning**: evaluates the presence and resolution of contradictions regarding the uniqueness constraint during the reasoning
    - *True (Corrected):* initial contradictions or explorations of incorrect paths are present, but the model **self-corrected**, reaching a conclusion consistent with the constraint
    - *True (Uncorrected):* contradictions that have not been resolved are present, leading to an incorrect or inconsistent conclusion in the reasoning
    - *False:* the reasoning is linear, no contradictions or explorations of incorrect paths are present from the beginning
    - *- (Not applicable):* to be selected **only** if the model completely ignored the topic during the reasoning (it never mentioned uniqueness)
- **Condition 2 Inconsistency - Reasoning**: evaluates the presence and resolution of contradictions regarding the management of the order of the elements during the reasoning
    - *True (Corrected):* initial contradictions or explorations of incorrect paths are present, but the model **self-corrected**, reaching a conclusion consistent with the constraint
    - *True (Uncorrected):* contradictions that have not been resolved are present, leading to an incorrect or inconsistent conclusion in the reasoning
    - *False:* the reasoning is linear, no contradictions or explorations of incorrect paths are present from the beginning
    - *- (Not applicable):* to be selected **only** if the model completely ignored the topic during the reasoning (it never mentioned order)
- **Condition 3 Inconsistency - Reasoning**: evaluates the presence and resolution of contradictions regarding the application of criteria for sorting by value
    - *True (Corrected):* the model initially proposed an incorrect or partial sorting, but **self-corrected**, finally defining the correct hierarchy
    - *True (Uncorrected):* the model presents unresolved contradictions or concludes the reasoning proposing a hierarchy that does not respect the required one
    - *False:* the reasoning is linear, no contradictions or explorations of incorrect paths are present from the beginning
    - *- (Not applicable):* to be selected **only** if the model completely ignored the topic during the reasoning (it never mentioned sorting)
- **Incorrect Statements - Output**: transcription of claims within the final answer that are contradictory or violate the prompt constraints
- **Incorrect Statements - Reasoning**: transcription of specific statements within the reasoning process that present contradictions but have subsequently been corrected
- **Time of Thought (seconds)**: duration of the model’s reasoning process (thought), expressed in seconds
- **Reasoning Steps**: number of logical steps produced by the model in the reasoning phase
- **Number of words in the thought (Words in Reasoning Phase)**: number of words generated during the reasoning phase
- **Number of words for the answer (Words in Final Answer)**: number of words contained in the final answer
- **Total number of words (Total Words Generated)**: overall length of the output, calculated as the sum of the words in the reasoning and the final answer
