- **Condition 3 Elements follow insertion order - Output (True/False)**: indicates whether the condition that elements are kept in insertion order appears in the text of the final answer
- **Condition 1 Inconsistency - Output (True/False/-)**: evaluates the presence of contradictions in the final answer regarding the uniqueness constraint
    - *True:* contradictions are present in the text of the answer
    - *False:* contradictions are not present
    - *- (Not applicable):* to be selected if *Condition 1 - Output* is **False**
- **Condition 2 Inconsistency - Output (True/False/-)**: evaluates the presence of contradictions in the final answer regarding the management of the order of the elements
    - *True:* contradictions are present in the text of the answer
    - *False:* contradictions are not present
    - *- (Not applicable):* to be selected if *Condition 2 - Output* is **False**
- **Condition 3 Inconsistency - Output (True/False/-)**: evaluates the presence of contradictions in the final answer regarding insertion order
    - *True:* contradictions are present in the text of the answer, or the proposed solution does not respect insertion order
    - *False:* contradictions are not present and insertion order is respected
    - *- (Not applicable)*: to be selected if *Condition 3 - Output* is **False**
- **Condition 1 Uniqueness of the elements - Reasoning (True/False)**: indicates whether, in the reasoning’s decision rationale (the sentences where the solution is stated and justified), the uniqueness constraint is explicitly mentioned and confirmed as satisfied by the selected data structure.
- **Condition 2 Order of the elements - Reasoning (True/False)**:  indicates whether, in the reasoning’s decision rationale (the sentences where the solution is stated and justified), the element-order constraint is explicitly mentioned and confirmed as satisfied by the selected data structure.
- **Condition 3 Elements follow insertion order - Reasoning (True/False)**: indicates whether, in the reasoning’s decision rationale (the sentences where the solution is stated and justified), the model explicitly confirms that the selected data structure preserves insertion order
- **Condition 1 Inconsistency - Reasoning**: evaluates the presence and resolution of contradictions regarding the uniqueness constraint during the reasoning
    - *True (Corrected):* initial contradictions or explorations of incorrect paths are present, but the model **self-corrected**, reaching a conclusion consistent with the constraint
    - *True (Uncorrected):* contradictions that have not been resolved are present, leading to an incorrect or inconsistent conclusion in the reasoning
    - *False:* the reasoning is linear, no contradictions or explorations of incorrect paths are present from the beginning
    - *- (Not applicable):* to be selected **only** if the model completely ignored the topic during the reasoning (it never mentioned uniqueness)
- **Condition 2 Inconsistency - Reasoning**: evaluates the presence and resolution of contradictions regarding the order preservation requirement during the reasoning
    - *True (Corrected):* initial contradictions or explorations of incorrect paths are present, but the model **self-corrected**, reaching a conclusion consistent with the constraint
    - *True (Uncorrected):* contradictions that have not been resolved are present, leading to an incorrect or inconsistent conclusion in the reasoning
    - *False:* the reasoning is linear, no contradictions or explorations of incorrect paths are present from the beginning
    - *- (Not applicable):* to be selected **only** if the model completely ignored the topic during the reasoning (it never mentioned order)
- **Condition 3 Inconsistency - Reasoning**: evaluates the presence and resolution of contradictions regarding insertion order during the reasoning
    - *True (Corrected):* the model initially proposed an incorrect or partial ordering claim, but **self-corrected**, finally confirming insertion order
    - *True (Uncorrected):* the model presents unresolved contradictions about insertion order, or proposing an ordering that is not insertion order
    - *False:* the reasoning is linear, no contradictions or explorations of incorrect paths are present from the beginning
    - *- (Not applicable):* to be selected **only** if it never mentioned insertion order
- **Incorrect Statements - Output**: transcription of claims within the final answer that are contradictory or violate the prompt constraints
- **Incorrect Statements - Reasoning**: transcription of specific statements within the reasoning that are contradictory and/or violate the prompt constraints (including corrected and uncorrected cases).
- **Time of Thought (seconds)**: duration of the model’s reasoning process (thought), expressed in seconds
- **Reasoning Steps**: number of logical steps produced by the model in the reasoning phase
- **Number of words in the thought (Words in Reasoning Phase)**: number of words generated during the reasoning phase
- **Number of words for the answer (Words in Final Answer)**: number of words contained in the final answer
- **Total number of words (Total Words Generated)**: overall length of the output, calculated as the sum of the words in the reasoning and the final answer
