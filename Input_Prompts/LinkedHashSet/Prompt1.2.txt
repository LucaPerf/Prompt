## Role

Act as a **senior Java developer** and advisor on data structures from the Java Collections Framework

## Task

- Provide an **initial checklist** of 3–6 conceptual bullet points outlining your evaluation steps.
- Evaluate **only** the following options: `HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap, LinkedList, ArrayList, LinkedHashSet, HashSet, TreeSet`.
- Select **one** data structure that best satisfies the requirements, then justify the choice and explain why the others are less suitable.

## Context

- You are developing an application for a cluster that manages a job registry
- A job has a **unique id** (job ID)
- The application must support the following **operations**:
    - **print** the job registry in insertion order. ****Note: this operation is executed frequently and requires real-time response
    - **submit** a new job if a job with the same job ID is not already present

## Reasoning

- **Do not state your chosen design until** the "**Final Choice**" section.
- Begin by **summarizing the requirements** (input format, sorting rules, duplicate handling).
- Define **decision criteria** for evaluating possible approaches
- Next, perform a **concise comparative assessment** of the candidate structures (pros/cons against the defined criteria).
- Present the final choice explicitly in the "Final Choice" section, with clear justification and rationale.

Note: Provide a concise, verifiable rationale. Describe your internal step-by-step thinking process.

## Output format

Output must include the following 7 clearly labeled sections in strict order, each section completed in full:

1. **Checklist** — 3–6 conceptual bullet points describing your planned evaluation steps (plain text, one per bullet).

2. **Requirements (Summary)** — Brief, one-line list of each key requirement drawn from context.

3. **Decision Criteria** — 4–6 criteria.

4. **Comparative Assessment** — Table (preferred) or list: For each candidate, state pros/cons by criterion. If using a table, columns should be: Candidate, [criteria 1], [criteria 2], ... (following your criteria from section 3), with concise remarks per cell. If using a list, enumerate candidates and sub-list pros/cons by criterion.

5. **Final Choice** — Only here provide the exact name of the chosen data structure and a sentence justification referencing the explicit criteria and requirements.

6. **Why Not the Others** — For each excluded candidate, explain the main reason for exclusion.

7. **Requirements Check** — For each summary requirement in section 2, provide a rationale describing how the chosen structure meets it. After completing this section, confirm that all requirements have been met; if not, explicitly indicate which ones have not been met.

## Stop conditions

You are done **only** when:

- all sections above are completed in order,
- the final choice is explicitly stated with justification,
- all non-chosen candidates are each given a reason for exclusion
